/**
 * Contains specific actions for a single company.
 * This package is created to implement a company specific functions/methods,
 * i.e creating search functions for a company which other companies doesn't need.
 * 
 * This also reduces the agony and pain in the ass of the programmer when reading the gory/lengthy code of an action class for multiple companies,
 * i.e {@link PageDispatcherAction}, as most(if not, all) pages goes through this action class.
 * 
 * As a sidenote regarding struts, the value of the attribute 'class' should be the company specific action/class 
 * and not the parent/super class.
 * i.e.: The value should be class="com.ivant.cms.action.company.CompanySpecificAction" 
 * and not, say class="com.ivant.cms.action.PageDispatcherAction".
